Maquette
=========

Maquette is a Javascript utility which makes it easy to synchronize the DOM tree in the browser with your data.
It uses a technique called 'Virtual DOM'.
Compared to other virtual DOM implementations, maquette has 3 advantages:

* It is very lightweight (3Kb gzipped)
* It allows changes to be animated
* It is optimized for speed
